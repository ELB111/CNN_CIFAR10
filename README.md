# CNN_CIFAR10

 Rudimentary case study using the Keras API along with the CIFAR10 dataset. 


 ## Code Structure

 The codebase uses Jupyter notebooks and Keras. The main contents are as follows:
 - `ComputerVision_Proj001.ipynb` contains code for loading CIFAR10 and training the model
 - `ComputerVision_Proj001_CustomDat.ipynb` contains code for loading a saved model and performing inference
 - `keras_cifar10_model.keras` located in /cnn_models is trained model
 - `keras_cifar10_model_augmented.keras` located in /cnn_models has been trained on augmented data
 - `data` folder contains a few .jpg for inference.


 ## Data
 
 Mor information regarding the training data (CIFAR10) can be found at 
 [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/691/cifar+10]. The images in the data
 folder have been randomly collected from various sources online.

 ## Intention

 Intended to serve as an introduction to CNN's (image classification) and working with Keras.
